# Tweepy API twitter_bot containerised with Docker
The following repo uses Tweepy: an open source Python package which abstracts a lot of complexity away in accessing Twitter API with Python. 
The python scripts are then containerised and are made an image, then run in an container which packages all code and its dependencies so it can virtually run on anything and anywhere regardless of OS restraints/versions, etc. 

## Getting Started
First of all you will need: 
1. Virtual environment to for your scripts
2. Docker installed on your workstation
3. API keys generated by Twitter API
